# TheDarkGenome
​I applied Algorithmic Information Theory and Deep Learning (Nano-Transformers) to the human Chromosome 21 to test a simple idea: if the non-coding DNA is truly "junk", it should look like random noise. It doesn't. ​My analysis found that the "Dark Genome" has a thermodynamic signature of a complex Operating System (H \approx 1.91 bits/base).
